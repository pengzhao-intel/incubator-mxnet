# Quantize custom models for production-level inference with MKL-DNN backend

The Apache MXNet* community delivered quantization approaches to improve performance and reduce the deployment costs for inference. There are two main benefits of lower precision (INT8). First, the computation can be accelerated by lower precision instruction, like VNNI. Second, lower precision data types save memory bandwidth and allow for better cache locality and power savings. The new quantization approach can realize up to a 4x performance speedup in the latest [AWS* EC2 C5 instances](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-available-new-c5-instance-sizes-and-bare-metal-instances/) with [Intel Deep Learning Boost](https://www.intel.ai/intel-deep-learning-boost/) enabled hardware with less than 0.5% accuracy drop.

## Installation and Prerequisites

Installing MXNet with MKL-DNN integration is an easy process. You can follow [How to build and install MXNet with MKL-DNN backend](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/tutorials/mkldnn/MKLDNN_README.html) to build and install MXNet with MKL-DNN from source. Also, You can install the release or nightly version via PyPi and pip directly by running:

```
# release version
pip install mxnet-mkl
# nightly version
pip install mxnet-mkl --pre
```

## Image Classification Quantization Demo

A new quantization script [imagenet_gen_qsym_mkldnn.py](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/example/quantization/imagenet_gen_qsym_mkldnn.py) has been designed to launch quantization for image-classification models with IntelÂ® MKL-DNN. This script integrates with [Gluon-CV modelzoo](https://gluon-cv.mxnet.io/model_zoo/classification.html), so that more pre-trained models can be downloaded from Gluon-CV and then converted for quantization. For details, you can refer [Model Quantization with Calibration Examples](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/example/quantization/README.md).

## Integrate Quantization Flow to Your Project

It's important to note that the quantization flow only work with the symbolic MXNet API. If you're using Gluon, you can first refer [Saving and Loading Gluon Models](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/versions/master/tutorials/gluon/save_load_params.html) to hybridize your computation graph and export it as a symbol before running quantization. The picture shows the quantization flow:

![quantization flow](quantization.png)

Take Gluon ResNet18 as an example.

### Model Initialization

```python
import logging
import mxnet as mx
from mxnet.gluon.model_zoo import vision
from mxnet.contrib.quantization import *

logging.basicConfig()
logger = logging.getLogger('logger')
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

batch_shape = (1, 3, 224, 224)
resnet18 = vision.resnet18_v1(pretrained=True)
resnet18.hybridize()
resnet18.forward(mx.nd.zeros(batch_shape))
resnet18.export('resnet18_v1')
sym, arg_params, aux_params = mx.model.load_checkpoint('resnet18_v1', 0)
# (optional) visualize float32 model
mx.viz.plot_network(sym)
```
First, we download resnet18-v1 model from gluon modelzoo and export it as a symbol. You can visualize float32 model. Below is a raw residual block.

### Model Fusion

```python
sym = sym.get_backend_symbol('MKLDNN_QUANTIZE')
# (optional) visualize fused float32 model
mx.viz.plot_network(sym)
```
It's important to add this line to enable graph fusion before quantization to get better performance. Below is a fused residual block. Batchnorm, Activation and elemwise_add are fused into Convolution.

### Quantize Model

Applying quantization by calling `quantiza_graph` api. Below are some descriptions for quantization apis and their params.

| param              | type            | description|
|--------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| excluded_sym_names | list of strings | A list of strings representing the names of the symbols that users want to excluding from being quantized.|
| calib_mode         | str             | If calib_mode='none', no calibration will be used and the thresholds for requantization after the corresponding layers will be calculated at runtime by calling min  and max operators. The quantized models generated in this mode are normally 10-20% slower than those with  calibrations during inference.<br>If calib_mode='naive', the min and max values of the layer outputs from a calibration dataset will be directly taken as the thresholds for quantization.<br>If calib_mode='entropy', the thresholds for quantization will be derived such that the KL divergence between the distributions of FP32 layer outputs and  quantized layer outputs is minimized based upon the calibration dataset. |
| calib_layer        | function        | Given a layer's output name in string, return True or False for deciding whether to calibrate this layer.<br>If yes, the statistics of the layer's output will be collected; otherwise, no information of the layer's output will be collected.<br>If not provided, all the layers' outputs that need requantization will be collected.|
| quantized_dtype    | str             | The quantized destination type for input data. Currently support 'int8', 'uint8' and 'auto'.<br>'auto' means automatically select output type according to calibration result.|

```python
# quantize configs
# set exclude layers
excluded_names = []
# set calib mode.
calib_mode = 'none'
# set calib_layer
calib_layer = None
# set quantized_dtype
quantized_dtype = 'auto'
logger.info('Quantizing FP32 model Resnet18-V1')
qsym, qarg_params, aux_params, collector = quantize_graph(sym=sym, arg_params=arg_params, aux_params=aux_params,
                                                          excluded_sym_names=excluded_names,
                                                          calib_mode=calib_mode, calib_layer=calib_layer,
                                                          quantized_dtype=quantized_dtype, logger=logger)
# (optional) visualize quantized model
mx.viz.plot_network(qsym)
# save quantized model
mx.model.save_checkpoint('quantized-resnet18_v1', 0, qsym, qarg_params, aux_params)
```

Below is a quantized residual block without calibration. We can see `_contrib_requantize` operators are inserted ater `Convolution` without calibration information.

![none calibrated model](none_calib.png)

### Evaluate/Tune INT8 Accuracy

Now, you get a pair of quantized symbol and params file, you can load them for inference. If you want to use gluon for int8 inference. You can load them as a SymbolBlock:

```python
quantized_net = mx.gluon.SymbolBlock.imports('quantized-resnet18_v1-symbol.json', 'data', 'quantized-resnet18_v1-0000.params')
quantized_net.hybridize(static_shape=True, static_alloc=True)
batch_size = 1
data = mx.nd.ones((batch_size,3,224,224))
quantized_net(data)
```

You can compare the int8 accuracy with float32. If the gap is big, you may need to exclude more layers and quantize the model again.

### Calibrate Model (optional)

The quantized model generated in previous steps can be very slow during inference since it will calculate min and max at runtime. We recommend using offline calibration for better performance by setting `calib_mode` to `naive` or `entropy` and then calling `set_monitor_callback` api to collect layer information with a subset of the validation datasets before int8 inference.

```python
# quantization configs
# set exclude layers
excluded_names = []
# set calib mode.
calib_mode = 'naive'
# set calib_layer
calib_layer = None
# set quantized_dtype
quantized_dtype = 'auto'
logger.info('Quantizing FP32 model resnet18-V1')
cqsym, cqarg_params, aux_params, collector = quantize_graph(sym=sym, arg_params=arg_params, aux_params=aux_params,
                                                          excluded_sym_names=excluded_names,
                                                          calib_mode=calib_mode, calib_layer=calib_layer,
                                                          quantized_dtype=quantized_dtype, logger=logger)

# download imagenet validation dataset
mx.test_utils.download('http://data.mxnet.io/data/val_256_q90.rec', 'dataset.rec')
# set rgb info for data
mean_std = {'mean_r': 123.68, 'mean_g': 116.779, 'mean_b': 103.939, 'std_r': 58.393, 'std_g': 57.12, 'std_b': 57.375}
# set batch size
batch_size = 16
# create DataIter
data = mx.io.ImageRecordIter(path_imgrec='dataset.rec', batch_size=batch_size, data_shape=batch_shape[1:], rand_crop=False, rand_mirror=False, **mean_std)
# create module
mod = mx.mod.Module(symbol=sym, label_names=None, context=mx.cpu())
mod.bind(for_training=False, data_shapes=data.provide_data, label_shapes=None)
mod.set_params(arg_params, aux_params)

# calibration configs
# set num_calib_batches
num_calib_batches = 5
max_num_examples = num_calib_batches * batch_size
# monitor FP32 Inference
mod._exec_group.execs[0].set_monitor_callback(collector.collect, monitor_all=True)
num_batches = 0
num_examples = 0
for batch in data:
    mod.forward(data_batch=batch, is_train=False)
    num_batches += 1
    num_examples += batch_size
    if num_examples >= max_num_examples:
        break
if logger is not None:
    logger.info("Collected statistics from %d batches with batch_size=%d"
                % (num_batches, batch_size))
```
After that, layer information will be filled into the `collector` returned by `quantize_graph` api. Then, you need to write the layer information into int8 model by calling `calib_graph` api.

```python
# write scaling factor into quantized symbol
cqsym, cqarg_params, aux_params = calib_graph(qsym=cqsym, arg_params=arg_params, aux_params=aux_params,
                                            collector=collector, calib_mode=calib_mode,
                                            quantized_dtype=quantized_dtype, logger=logger)
# (optional) visualize quantized model
mx.viz.plot_network(cqsym)
```

Below is a quantized residual block with naive calibration. We can see `min_calib_range` and `max_calib_range` are wrote into `_contrib_requantize` operators.

![naive calibrated model](naive_calib.png)

When you get a quantized model with calibration, keep sure to call fusion api again since this can fuse some `requantize` or `dequantize` operators for further performance improvement.

```python
# perform post-quantization fusion
cqsym = cqsym.get_backend_symbol('MKLDNN_QUANTIZE')
# (optional) visualize post-quantized model
mx.viz.plot_network(cqsym)
# save quantized model
mx.model.save_checkpoint('quantized-resnet18_v1', 0, cqsym, cqarg_params, aux_params)
```

Below is a post-quantized residual block. We can see `_contrib_requantize` operators are fused into `Convolution` operators.

![post-quantized model](post_quantize.png)

BTW, You can also modify the `min_calib_range` and `max_calib_range` in the JSON file directly.

```
    {
      "op": "_sg_mkldnn_conv", 
      "name": "quantized_sg_mkldnn_conv_bn_act_6", 
      "attrs": {
        "max_calib_range": "3.562147", 
        "min_calib_range": "0.000000", 
        "quantized": "true", 
        "with_act": "true", 
        "with_bn": "true"
      }, 
......
```

### Tips for Model Calibration

#### Accuracy Tuning

- Try to use `entropy` calib mode;

- Try to exclude some layers which may cause obvious accuracy drop;

- Change calibration dataset by setting different `num_calib_batches` or shuffle your validation dataset;

#### Performance Tuning

- Keep sure to perform graph fusion before quantization;

- If lots of `requantize` layers exist, keep sure to perform post-quantization fusion after calibration;

- Compare the MXNet profile or `MKLDNN_VERBOSE` of float32 and int8 inference;

## Deploy with Python/C++

MXNet also supports deploy quantized models with C++. Refer [MXNet C++ Package](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/cpp-package/README.md) for more details.
